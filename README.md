Everything right in your slack channel!
------------------------------------

Charmander is a bot for Slack to do everything for you. You don't need to open browser to search for something because Charmander searches everything from Google and shows top results to you right in your slack channel! 

**Note**: Done with the Bot configuration files. Next Commit after 5th Jan. (New year celebrations :beers:) Stay tuned for updates!

**Why am I doing this?**
I created a blot for Slack [The L](https://github.com/vicky002/slack-TheL) which uses Wolframalpha API, check [Tutorial here](http://eulercoder.me/posts/How-to-create-Slack-Bot-using-wolframalpha-API/). Wolframalpha allows only 2000 calls per month. It was hard to set up and was not of that much use. Charmander directly searches from the Google to answer your queries. And it's all free to use. Its very easy to setup in your slack channel.
